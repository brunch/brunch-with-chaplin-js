    * [Bower](http://bower.io): `npm install -g bower`
    * Brunch plugins and Bower dependencies: `npm install & bower install`
* Run:
    * `brunch watch --server` — watches the project with continuous rebuild. This will also launch HTTP server with [pushState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history).
    * `brunch build --production` — builds minified project for production

# For newcomers

Brunch with Chaplin is a skeleton (boilerplate) for [Brunch](http://brunch.io)
based on [Chaplin](http://chaplinjs.org) architecture. Requires Brunch 1.7+.

Example application built with the skeleton:
[Ost.io](https://github.com/paulmillr/ostio).

This branch does not contain ready-to-use test environment.
If you want take a look how tests can be used, see `with-tests` git branch.

## Difference from Chaplin Boilerplate
[Chaplin Boilerplate](https://github.com/chaplinjs/chaplin-boilerplate)
is a official boilerplate all for chaplin. This skeleton is almost the same,
except a few changes:

* Added Header.
* CommonJS is used instead of AMD, because it's easier to use & debug.

## Features
* HTML5Boilerplate html & css are included.
* CoffeeScript + Stylus + Handlebars as app languages
(you can change this to anything you want)
* Backbone as main MVC/MVP library, Chaplin as meta-framework.
* Support of IE8 and up.
* Cross-module communication using the Mediator and Publish/Subscribe patterns
* Controllers for managing individual UI views
* Rails-style routes which map URLs to controller actions
* An application view as dispatcher and view manager
* Extended model, view and collection classes to avoid repetition and
enforce conventions
* Strict memory management and object disposal
* A collection with additional manipulation methods for smarter change events
* A collection view for easy and intelligent list rendering

## Authentication
If you build an application with authentication, there are some useful abstractions for it out there: https://github.com/chaplinjs/chaplin-auth.
